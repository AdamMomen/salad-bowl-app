# Salad Bowl Game
### Overview
Salad Bowl is a recreation of a guessing game my friends and I played in college. It's made with React Native and Firebase, and it allows you to play with your friends in realtime, either in person or via video call. Here's a [video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEIdt2TMGPo) of the game, and here's a [video overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYLtlG2sqHI) of how the game was made using firebase.

### How It Works
Salad Bowl is a guessing game with 3 rounds and requires a minimum of 4 people to play. In each round, one person plays against the clock to get their team to guess the most words or phrases as possible!  
  
Before the game starts, each person adds a certain amount of words or phrases into the salad bowl. These words or phrases are what you have to get your team to guess each round. After each round, the words are recycled back into the game.  
  
But there's a catch! There's different rules for each round. In round one, you can only explain the word or phrase without using any gestures. In round two, you can only act out the word or phrase without making any noises. In the last and hardest round, you can only say one word to get your team to guess the word. This may seem hard, but remember that the words are recycled each round, so your teammates have to use their memory and association to guess the words!  
  
After you play one game, you'll never want to stop playing! The best part is that this game can be played by anyone, whether in person or remotely! When in person, everyone can hop on their phones and start up the game! When playing remotely, just jump on a video call and start the game!
